# House inventory web app

I keep losing my stuff, so I decided to make myself an inventory web app using Django.

Here it is for your enjoyment.

## Features

- Based on the proven Django Admin web interface
- Nested locations
- Customizable location codes
    - i.e. Living room > Cabinet > 3rd drawer: `LR.CAB.D3`
- Item categories
- Batch operations:
    - Move multiple items into another location
    - Assign categories
    - Create "tabular" cabinet shelf locations
- Filtering by location, category
- Search
- Item expiration (though no reminders)
